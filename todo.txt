1. Create an EKS Cluster, IAM Role for CodeBuild, and Authorize the CodeBuild
   Create an EKS Cluster - Start with creating an EKS cluster in your preferred region, using eksctl command.
   IAM Role for CodeBuild - Create an IAM role that the Codebuild will assume to access your k8s/EKS cluster. This IAM role will have the necessary access permissions (attached JSON policies),
   Authorize the CodeBuild using EKS RBAC - Add IAM Role to the Kubernetes cluster's configMap.

2. Deployment to Kubernetes using CodePipeline and CodeBuild
  Generate a Github access token
  Cenerate an access-token from your Github account. We will share this token with the Codebuild service so that it can listen to the the repository commits.
  Create Codebuild and CodePipeline resources using CloudFormation template
  Create a pipeline watching for commits to your Github repository using Cloudformation template (.yaml) file.
  Set a Secret using AWS Parameter Store
  In order to pass your JWT secret to the app in Kubernetes securely, you will set the JWT secret using AWS parameter store.
  Build and deploy
  Finally, you will trigger the build based on a Github commit.
